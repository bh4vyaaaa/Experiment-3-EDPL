### Theory :
Python lists are one of the most important built-in data structures used to store a collection of elements in a single variable. A list is an ordered sequence, which means the elements are stored in a specific order and can be accessed using index values starting from zero. Lists are mutable in nature, allowing modification of their elements after creation. They also allow duplicate values and can store different data types such as integers, strings, boolean values, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers in the same list.
In this experiment, various list operations were studied in detail. The length of a list was obtained using the len() function. Elements were accessed using both positive and negative indexing. Negative indexing was used to access elements from the end of the list. List slicing was performed to extract a specific range of elements using start and end indices, including slicing with negative indices.
The experiment also included modification of list elements by assigning new values to specific index positions. Different methods for adding elements to a list were used. The append() method was used to add an element at the end of the list, the insert() method was used to add an element at a particular index, and the extend() method was used to add multiple elements from another list. Searching for elements and repeating list elements using the multiplication operator were also demonstrated.
Various built-in functions such as max(), min(), and sum() were used to perform calculations on list data. The average of list elements was calculated using the sum and length of the list. The sort() method was used to arrange elements in ascending order. These operations helped in understanding how data stored in lists can be analyzed and organized efficiently.
Real-life applications of lists were also implemented in this experiment. Lists were used to store and analyze student marks, manage grocery shopping items, maintain phone contacts, analyze daily temperature readings, and track daily expenses. These programs demonstrated the practical use of lists in everyday data handling tasks.

### Conclusion:
Thus, Python list operations were successfully studied and implemented. We learned how to create lists, access and modify elements, perform slicing, and apply various list methods and built-in functions. The experiment demonstrated that lists are a flexible and powerful data structure suitable for storing and managing data in real-life applications. This experiment helped in developing a clear understanding of list operations and their importance in Python programming
